This repository contains a Python script `similarity.py` that computes the similarity between two code files using character and line metrics.

The comparison is flexible and ignores differences caused solely by whitespace, line breaks, or inline comments starting with `//` or `;`.  Both character-based and line-based scores range from `0` (completely different) to `1` (identical).
